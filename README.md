Lazy.nvim make me change everything. Now is just a long "init.lua" file.

* Plugins:

    - mkdnflow = Modern "vimwiki"
    - vim-fugitive = Sir Tpope!
    - and more? idk

* Options and Remaps:

I do not understand the "register" thing so i delete those.
Same with some options like the "updatetime"
